# General Notes 

## Section 2: Install and Setup

- Oracle, the owners of Java, have started charging people to use Java.  However students and people learning java do not generally have to pay.  Up until Aug 2017, Oracle used to release a new version of java every 2 years.  Now Oracle has transitioned to LTS, so will support certain versions of java in the long term. Java SE 7, 8, 11 and 17 are LTS releases.
- In this course we will use JDK 11.
